### 📜 Personal Manifesto

A Software Engineer with EE Engineering bachelor. Currently studing on Master Degree in Computer Science and, Works at a company called AVL


**Motto :** This guy writes code that works in her local. He focus on solving real problems, with decorating solutions.

### Project Highlights (A.K.A. University Days - Until 2020)

 - **[Autonomous Rc Vehicle (2018)](https://www.youtu.be/4Nb80rs3ln4):** It was university 'Electronics 1 course' project, and It is my first and favorite one :)
 - **[TheShortestPathFinderWithGui (2019)](https://github.com/ilkaydost/TheSortestPathFinderWithGraphGuiWithQt):** It was university project to find shortest path given nodes using Qt
 - **[Unity Based Game (2019)](https://youtu.be/TTV0rXFaxtg):** Simple game with using Unity for Electronics 2 course
 - **[BasicPathFollower (2020)](https://github.com/ilkaydost/BasicPathFollower):** It is basic path following algorithm for tricycle vehicle. It is creates path according to set points in x-y coordinates then interpolates. Then it follows path according tricyle vehicle steering dynamics
 - **[BasicMessageParser (2022)](https://github.com/ilkaydost/BasicMessageParser):** Just warm-up five year old kid style, too basic project
 - **[PointCloudLab (2026)](https://github.com/ilkaydost/PointCloudLib):** Implemented AI-aided, profesional looking point cloud analyzer application - (Development in progress)
